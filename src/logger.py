'''
Why is this Logging Required?

Debugging: Logging provides detailed insights into the programâ€™s flow and helps trace where and why errors occur.

Monitoring: Logs record important events and states during execution, which can be useful for monitoring application performance and behavior.

Auditing: They offer a record of activities that can be reviewed later, useful for auditing or post-mortem analysis in case of issues.

Maintenance: Clear logs simplify the maintenance process by allowing developers to quickly pinpoint issues without stepping through code with a debugger.
